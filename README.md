# Game Theory MinMax

One of the homeworks for the Artificial Intelligence class I took at UW-Madison the fall of 2020. 

The goals of the homework were: 

1. Design a artificially intelligent Teeko player
2. Implement a personal heuristic function
3. Implement a successor state generation function
4. Implement a MinMax algorithm
